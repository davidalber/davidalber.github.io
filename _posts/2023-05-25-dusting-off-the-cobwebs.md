It's been over four years since I posted here! I need to create a
release post for Geneagrapher. That's coming next.

However, before I was able to do that, there was a hang-up: my setup
had bit rot to the point that I couldn't run the site locally. That
presumably meant that publishing an update to the site would have
broken it.

There was some confluence of current Ruby not working with the old
Jekyll, followed by current Ruby and current Jekyll not working
because something else was removed from Ruby, followed by some Jekyll
configuration I had breaking some other thing in the updated
stack. That's all been sorted out.

Get ready for at least one more post before this goes dormant again.
