summary:    I started baking loaves of sourdough bread this spring. Here are some of my creations.

I have been maintaining a colony of wild yeast since earlier this
year, and starting in late March I began preparing and baking loaves
of sourdough bread. For me at least, it is a fairly time-consuming
process, but the results are pretty amazing.

I still have a lot to learn, but even the loaves that are obviously
(to me) defective in some way are still delicious.

The changes that the dough goes through in a couple hours is really
interesting. It goes from being a ball of flour and starter to a dough
with a strong gluten network that is jiggly, slippery, and is able to
hold its shape.

To date, I have made eleven loaves of bread with three recipes. The
main difference between the recipes is the ratio of whole wheat flour
to bread flour.

The images below show stages of the process, starting after bulk
fermentation through to completion.
