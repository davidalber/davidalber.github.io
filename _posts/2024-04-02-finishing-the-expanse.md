summary:    I am nearing the end of the final book in The Expanse series.
---

I've been working my way through the books and short stories of _The
Expanse_ for about 1.5 years. I started the ninth and final book,
_Leviathan Wakes_, a couple weeks ago and am approaching to
conclusion. There's one more short story after book nine, and then
that's it.

It is always a little bit of a struggle for me to wrap up long stories
like this because I feel sad moving on from the characters and world,
and this will be no different. I have really enjoyed the story, and I
will miss Naomi, Jim, Alex, Amos, Clarissa, Bobby, and, of course,
_Rocinante_.

Here's the start of the book on a Kindle that a coworker called "the
world's oldest Kindle" almost ten years ago.
